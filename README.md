### Note regarding excluding inherited files from Ozone Pro Distro:

It is possible to exclude some of the files inherited from the Ozone Pro Distribution, thus also the OpenMRS Distro Reference Application.
To do so, provide your exclusion regular expression in the [dependency-excludes.txt](dependency-excludes.txt) file.

Eg:
```
\.\*openmrs_config.\demo*csv
```
